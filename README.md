# Backdoor-and-keylogger
creating an undetectable backdoor

In this project we are going to create a backdoor using python
programming. We will implement several features in that backdoor that
can gain full remote access to the target host and bypass antivirus.
• A backdoor is a malware type that negates normal authentication
procedures to access a system. As a result, remote access is granted to
resources within an application, such as databases and file servers,
giving perpetrators the ability to remotely issue system commands and
update malware.
• Backdoor installation is achieved by taking advantage of vulnerable
components in a web application. Once installed, detection is difficult
as files tends to be highly obfuscated.
• Our Primary goal is to gain Full access to the target command prompt,
Key logger program to monitor the keyboard, Trying to gather saved
Wi-Fi passwords and account passwords, Uploading a file to the target
system, Downloading a file from the target system, Modifying files in
the target system, Deleting or replacing files in target system, Executing
a new program, Stop a service or a program, etc..
• The special features that we are going to implement are Backdoor will
be undetectable by any antivirus, Backdoor will be persistence hence
event when the target restarts the system the backdoor will start
automatically (Running on start-up), Hiding its originality means
converting the backdoor by changing its appearance by looks like pdf
or image etc.
• Another objective is to create a keylogger program to monitor the key
strike of a target host and send a report to our mail id, by this we can be
able to access sensitive information like passwords usernames etc.
